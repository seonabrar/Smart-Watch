# SMART WATCH â€“ HEALTH AND FITNESS MONITORING SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT
This project presents the design and implementation of a multi-functional embedded system integrating various sensors and modules for environmental monitoring, user interaction, and health metrics. The core of the system is the Seeed Studio Xiao NRF52840 microcontroller, which orchestrates the operation of several connected components. 

## INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements, implementation, and testing plan for Health and Fitness Monitoring System, also referred to as the "Smart Watch." This system is designed to cater to outdoor enthusiasts by providing real-time tracking and monitoring of vital health metrics and activity levels. The document aims to outline what the device is intended to achieve, how it has implemented, and the testing procedures to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. The ultimate goal is to enhance performance, safety, and overall well-being during outdoor activities such as hiking, trail running, and mountain biking.
